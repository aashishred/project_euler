# project_euler

Project Euler is a website with a series of problems intended to be solved by computation.

Repository contains my solutions (so far, only in Python).

I will only upload the solution if I have an implementation which runs in one minute or less, but I will include prior, less efficient implementations in the file. In these cases, or for cases in which the solution takes more than a few seconds to run, comments indicate how long the program takes to arrive at a solution.

Currently uploaded: Python (Problems 1-17)
